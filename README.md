# RESTAPI-Robot-Based-Grid-Navigation-
Repository containing code for client side architecture

These group of files essentially portray how we created the client side architecture of a Robot Based Grid Navigation system. The project consisted of how a robot created with the help of Raspberry Pi 2 was controlled using a client side API that was built using REST on the Jersey framework. The data collected by the robot was stored in a cloud server created on top of the Pi. The responses received were in the form of XML texts and the response files have also been added.
